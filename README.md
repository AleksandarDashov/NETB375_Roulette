NETB375_Roulette
================
<h2>General information:</h2>

<p>
This is a course that was held in my university.
We were divided into 3 people teams and we had to make
an app using Qt. 

Overall I am pleased with what turned out from the project
given that all non prototyping was done in 3 days.
The mainwindow class is horribly made with a huge amount of
redundancy. I am aware of that, but there was no time to refactor
what already was written by my teammates.

<h2>Installation and running</h2>
<p>
In case someone want's to build it, just import the project in a QT creator 
and you can build it. Like always there is a catch - the save / load won't work 
since there is default path hardcoded in the source code. It is a bad practice
but it will have to do. In order for the save to work you need to edit the path
which is passed in the constructor of the mainwindow class.

If there are any questions feel free to open a bug and I will do my best to answer it.
